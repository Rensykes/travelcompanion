/// A service that detects the user's SIM and network ISO country codes.
///
/// This service provides functionality to detect a user's current country
/// based on their mobile network connection. It's primarily used for
/// automatic country detection in location tracking.
///
/// It uses the country_detector package which can access:
/// - SIM ISO code - Represents the country where the SIM card was issued (remains constant)
/// - Network ISO code - Indicates the country of the mobile network the user is
///   currently connected to (can change with roaming)
class SimInfoService {
  /// Returns the current network ISO code (based on the network the user is connected to).
  ///
  /// This method attempts to detect the country by checking the mobile network
  /// the device is currently connected to. It prioritizes the network ISO code
  /// since this reflects the user's current location more accurately than the SIM code.
  ///
  /// Returns:
  /// - A two-letter ISO country code (e.g., "US", "FR") if detection is successful
  /// - null if no country code could be detected or if an error occurs
